## Introduction

After obtaining detailed information on all the regions of the world that produce red wine.

 I have decided to select the Spanish wineries to carry out an analysis of how the climate, with hot summers and spring rains, has positive effects on the harvests, making the years in which they are given these conditions, the grape is of exceptional quality

## Goals

The objective after cleaning the csv and getting to the best quality Spanish wineries is to contrast with a meteorological API if it is true that after the hottest summers the best grapes are given for the creation of Spanish wine.
